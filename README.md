# Dotfiles 
## My personal configs for bash, git, vim etc.
## Run install.sh for your own use

# bash_profile and bash_prompt are shrunk version(and slightly modified) from [this completion](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
# vimrc is inspired from  [this config](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
